## project for object-oriented programming classes
***
WPF application written in C# programming language.

Written during the first semester, looking at it now, I would definitely solve some problems the other way, or use a little different syntax here and there.
***
Made with no real knowledge of Git or Github.

**Projekt-zaliczeniowy** is a simulation of a simple internet store application. Some basic seed data is creating an administrator account.
It was made to purely help me improve my C# skills and practice with Entity Framework, and LINQ query.
Started without any knowledge of WPF, Entity Framework and LINQ.
